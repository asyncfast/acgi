# Receiving

Receiving messages is handled by the `@app.channel(name)` decorator.

```{eval-rst}
.. async-fast-example:: examples/payload_basemodel.py
```

You can process and parse the payload, parameters, and headers of a message.

```{toctree}
:hidden:
message_payload
message_headers
channel_parameters
```
